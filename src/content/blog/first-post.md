# Getting Started with Static Site Generators

*Posted on January 1, 2024*

Static site generators are a great way to create fast, secure websites. In this post, I'll share my experience building this website and why I chose to use a simple static site generator.

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites offer several advantages:
- Faster loading times
- Better security
- Simpler deployment
- Lower hosting costs

## The Build Process

Here's how this site converts Markdown to HTML:

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Process files using Node.js
3. Generate static HTML
4. Deploy to hosting

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll cover:
- Adding dynamic features
- Implementing a contact form
- Setting up an email newsletter

Stay tuned for more updates!
